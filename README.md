# gotraceui - an efficient frontend for Go execution traces

Gotraceui is a tool for visualizing and analyzing Go execution traces. It is meant to be a faster, more accessible, and
more powerful alternative to `go tool trace`. Unlike `go tool trace`, Gotraceui doesnâ€™t use deprecated browser APIs (or a
browser at all), and its UI is tuned specifically to the unique characteristics of Go traces.

## Use

Gotraceui is still a work in progress with many sharp corners, but you can already try it out. Simply build
`honnef.co/go/gotraceui/cmd/gotraceui` and run it, passing the path to a trace file as the only argument. See the
documentation of [runtime/trace](https://pkg.go.dev/runtime/trace) on how to obtain traces, and see [Gio's
instructions](https://gioui.org/doc/install) to figure out the dependencies required for building Gotraceui.

## Controls

None of these controls are final. Users without a middle mouse button will have a bad experience right now.

## Notes

No aspect of Gotraceui is final yet, but do note that bright pink and bright yellow are debug colors and I never thought
they were a good idea. The rest of the color scheme is actually meant to be pleasant.

## Known issues

- [runtime/trace: time stamps out of order](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/16755)
- Timelines with millions of events can be a bit slow to render
