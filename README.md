# gotraceui - an efficient frontend for Go execution traces

Gotraceui is a tool for visualizing and analyzing Go execution traces. It is meant to be a faster, more accessible, and
more powerful alternative to `go tool trace`. Unlike `go tool trace`, Gotraceui doesnâ€™t use deprecated browser APIs (or a
browser at all), and its UI is tuned specifically to the unique characteristics of Go traces.

## Status

Gotraceui still has some sharp corners, hasn't had its first release yet and is lacking a manual. It is, however, fairly
usable, and people have already used it productively.

## Installation

Users of Nix can use the flake. There are no packages for other distributions or OSs yet and you will have to build
`honnef.co/go/gotraceui/cmd/gotraceui` yourself. [Gio's instructions](https://gioui.org/doc/install) explain the
dependencies for the various platforms.

## Notes for package maintainers

When packaging Gotraceui please take care to

- pass `-X gioui.org/app.ID=co.honnef.Gotraceui` to the linker
- install the `share` directory
- call the package `gotraceui`, _please_
- include the `LICENSE-THIRD-PARTY` file; it contains all the licenses and copyright notices of all dependencies and all
  code our code is derived from. Including this file satisfies the requirement of reproducing copyright notices and
  permission notices.

If you want to package the manual, `make gotraceui.pdf` builds it.

## Known issues

- [runtime/trace: time stamps out of order](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/16755)
- Timelines with millions of events can be a bit slow to render
